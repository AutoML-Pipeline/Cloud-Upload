Styling Policy
Never use inline styles (style={{ ... }}) in React.

Use CSS Modules for component styles:

Local: src/components/ComponentName/ComponentName.module.css

Shared: src/styles/components/*.module.css

Class naming: ComponentName, ComponentName--variant, ComponentName__part.

Reuse design tokens from src/styles/tokens.css; donâ€™t hardcode colors/sizes.

Use a consistent layout container for page content. To ensure proper alignment and avoid excessive or uneven empty space, wrap main page sections in a container class. This class should have a max-width and be centered with margin: 0 auto;. This prevents the layout from looking unbalanced on wider screens.

No global selectors; avoid :global unless integrating third-party CSS.

Refactors must be surgical:

Modify only files explicitly requested in the task.

Output unified diff patches with 3 lines of context per hunk.

Do not change unrelated files, exports, or public APIs.
