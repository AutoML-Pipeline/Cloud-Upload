## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Before Testing:
- [ ] Backend server is running on port 8000
- [ ] Frontend dev server is running on port 5173
- [ ] At least one feature-engineered dataset exists in MinIO

### Test Cases:

#### Test 1: Classification Problem
- [ ] Navigate to Model Training page
- [ ] Select a classification dataset
- [ ] Click "Continue to Configuration"
- [ ] Select a categorical target column
- [ ] Verify AI recommendations appear
- [ ] Verify problem type is "Classification"
- [ ] Verify recommended models are auto-selected
- [ ] Click "Start Training"
- [ ] Wait for training to complete
- [ ] Verify comparison table appears
- [ ] Verify Performance Comparison chart appears
- [ ] Verify Radar Chart appears (top 3 models)
- [ ] Verify Confusion Matrix appears for best model
- [ ] Verify Feature Importance chart appears
- [ ] Check that best model is highlighted in green

#### Test 2: Regression Problem
- [ ] Select a regression dataset
- [ ] Select a continuous target column
- [ ] Verify AI recommendations detect "Regression"
- [ ] Train models
- [ ] Verify Performance Comparison chart shows R² scores
- [ ] Verify Residual Plot appears
- [ ] Verify Feature Importance chart appears
- [ ] No Radar Chart (classification only)
- [ ] No Confusion Matrix (classification only)

#### Test 3: Edge Cases
- [ ] Test with small dataset (<100 rows)
- [ ] Test with large dataset (>10,000 rows)
- [ ] Test with high-cardinality target (many unique values)
- [ ] Test with missing values in target column
- [ ] Test with dataset that has many features (>50)

### UI/UX Testing:
- [ ] All charts are responsive on mobile
- [ ] Hover tooltips work on all charts
- [ ] No console errors in browser
- [ ] Loading states show correctly
- [ ] Progress bar updates smoothly
- [ ] Recommended model badges display correctly
- [ ] Confusion matrix colors are visible
- [ ] Feature importance labels are readable

### Performance Testing:
- [ ] Training completes in reasonable time (<30s for small datasets)
- [ ] Charts render without lag
- [ ] No memory leaks (check DevTools)
- [ ] Visualization data doesn't exceed response size limits

## 🐛 Troubleshooting Guide

### Issue: Charts not rendering
**Solution:**
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify Chart.js is installed: `npm list chart.js`
3. Check that trainingResult prop has required data structure

### Issue: Confusion matrix empty
**Solution:**
1. Check backend logs for errors in metrics calculation
2. Verify best_model.confusion_matrix exists in response
3. Check that matrix is 2D array format

### Issue: Feature importance not showing
**Solution:**
1. Some models don't have feature importance (e.g., basic SVM)
2. Check model has `feature_importances_` or `coef_` attribute
3. Backend logs will show "Could not extract feature importance"

### Issue: Residuals not showing (regression)
**Solution:**
1. Check problem_type is "regression" not "classification"
2. Verify best_model.residuals exists in response
3. Check backend logs for calculation errors

### Issue: Recommended models not auto-selecting
**Solution:**
1. Verify recommendations API endpoint returns data
2. Check target column is valid
3. Check console logs for recommendation loading errors
4. Verify model_recommendations array has items with recommended=true

### Issue: Backend import errors
**Solution:**
1. Restart backend server: `uvicorn main:app --reload`
2. Check Python path includes backend directory
3. Verify all sklearn imports are available

### Issue: "No module named 'backend'"
**Solution:**
1. Backend uses relative imports
2. Must run from backend directory: `cd backend; uvicorn main:app --reload`
3. Or set PYTHONPATH: `$env:PYTHONPATH="D:\Cloud-Upload\backend"`
